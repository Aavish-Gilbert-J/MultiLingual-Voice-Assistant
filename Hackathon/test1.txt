many people helping injured passengers, shouting about details of the shooting, and requesting 
emergency services.[17]

cameras in three subway stations.[9] Police obtained a picture of the suspect from a bystander's cell 
phone video.[21] A $50,000 reward was offered for information leading to the suspect's arrest.[22] 
Reco vered from the train at the scene were several items, including a  Glock 9 -millimeter  handgun, 
three  ammunition magazines , a credit card in the name of Frank R. James, and a key to a U -Haul

many people helping injured passengers, shouting about details of the shooting, and requesting 
emergency services.[17]

cameras in three subway stations.[9] Police obtained a picture of the suspect from a bystander's cell 
phone video.[21] A $50,000 reward was offered for information leading to the suspect's arrest.[22] 
Reco vered from the train at the scene were several items, including a  Glock 9 -millimeter  handgun, 
three  ammunition magazines , a credit card in the name of Frank R. James, and a key to a U -Haul
